This program converts text from an input file to an image
that consits of black and white squares, where a black
square represents a binary value of true, and a white square
represents the binary false. The image is sized to be a square.
The images this outputs are quite interesting to look at and
give somewhat of a direct representation of how data is stored
in binary in a modern computer. I hope you find this result of
me doodling around as interesting as I do.

To use this drag and drop files on run.bat. Execution will depend
on the file type. A text file will be converted to an image and
an images contents will be parsed and printed.
